Fake News Detection
Objective
Developed a machine learning model to predict whether news articles are fake or real.

Project Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify news articles as fake or real. The process includes data cleaning, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

Steps
1. Data Cleaning
   Removed punctuation and special characters using re and string libraries.

2. Feature Extraction
Converted text data into numerical features using TfidfVectorizer.

3. Model Training
Trained the Gradient Boosting Classifier on the training data.

4. Evaluation
   Assessed the modelâ€™s accuracy and generated a classification report.
5. Conclusion
   The model successfully predicts whether news articles are fake or real with a good accuracy rate. Further improvements can be made by experimenting with different models
   and feature extraction techniques.
